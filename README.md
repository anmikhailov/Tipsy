## About this app
This is a Tips calculator. Based on bill total, tip percentage and number of people it will calculate total money for each person. 
In this app I use:
* UIKit/programmatically layout.
* Multi-screen apps with animated navigation.
* Optional binding, optional chaining and the nil coalescing operator.
* Formatting Strings.
* UITextField and UIStepper
